# components
I will be adding more frontend components and techniques used in popular apps by tech giants

1 . Content placeholder 

It is a effective frontend magic used by popular web apps to compromise users with effective web performance and UX

How it works?
Show a content placeholder instead of blank screen or loader to give a feel of progress.Once fully loaded replace it with actual content.

Used widely by Facebook,Medium,LinkedIn,Quora etc.
